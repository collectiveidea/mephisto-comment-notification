Mephisto Comment Notification
=============================

A small extension to the Mephisto blogging engine for those who prefer email notifications over the RSS feeds.

This simple plugin hooks up an observer to the Mephisto Comment model and sends an email notification to the Site administrator each time a new comment is posted.

Install the plugin as normal (use svn co instead of script/plugin as this plugin uses trunk/tags):

  svn co http://opensource.agileevolved.com/svn/root/rails_plugins/mephisto_comment_notification/trunk/ vendor/plugins/mephisto_comment_notification

Make sure ActionMailer is configured correctly for your server, restart your web server and off you go!
